# Facial_Recognition
This is the repository for the machine learning final project of facial recognition.



- As for the facial_recognition.py file, you need to download the pretrained data from the vgg and you can easily search it by google.
- Next, it is easy for you to put your picture into the photo document and you just need to follow the rule of photo/name and that is fine.
- You can change the number to form the train and test photos by yourself based on some prior knowledge. And you can choose to train the model or not
- And for the prediction part, there are two ways to do the prediction. One is that only detect one face and the other is that it can simultaneously recognize more than one face.
- Hope you can enjoy that and it is easy to manipulate because there are enough comments.
